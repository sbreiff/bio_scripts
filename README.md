### bio_scripts

Contains assorted scripts that I used to work with genetic and genomic data.


#### Contents:

1. SeqTools.py - collection of functions for dealing with sequence data.
- rev_comp - reverse complements a nucleotide sequence.
- translate - translates a DNA sequence into an amino acid sequence.

2. gff_to_fasta.py - a script that takes in a genome fasta file and a gff file of genes, and outputs a fasta file of the genes in the gff.

3. get_seqs.py - a script that takes in a list of sequences and a fasta file that contains those sequences, and outputs a fasta file containing only the sequences in the list.
